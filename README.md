# Data-Clustering-Using-Hybrid-Algorithms for identifying Disease Infected Locations
For implementing hybrid algorithms I haven scrutinied various research paper of machine learning algorithms and work accordingly.
The Implement algorithms are I.K-means+DBscan,II.FuzzyCmean+DBScan,III.KMeans+Firefly.
The mentioned algothims were checked properly on Benchmark Mopsi Dataset which contains 6014 coordinates of locations in Finland for finding disease locations.
